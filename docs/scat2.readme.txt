I modified SCAT to make it a bit easier to use.
Specifically:
i) the regionfile can now contain regions not represented
among the input individuals. The nice thing about this is that
now we can use the same region file, for any input file (previously I had to 
		make a new region file for each new input file)
ii) when doing the continuous assignments,
	you can specify a file of samples to be assigned, rather than 
	including them in the input file. To do this, use 
	-Massignmentfile.txt (no space betweeen M and filename).
	Also you can specify a directory into which all the assignment files will be output using -sassigndirname (no space between s and directory name). Make
	sure this directroy exists before running SCAT2!
iii) you no longer specify the number of regions or the number
of individuals - it counts them automatically. You do need to specify
number of loci still though (16 in this case).

Also note that the undocumented -d and -D options.
-d specifies to use boundaries on the assignemnts appropriate for forest samples
-D specifies to use boundaries appropriate for savanna samples

See examples in batch.txt
