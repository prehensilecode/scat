Repository for the SCAT code from (Wasser et al.)[http://www.pnas.org/content/104/10/4228.full] 

If you download this code, please take a moment to "star" the repo (click star).
This will let me know that someone is interested in using the code, which will allow me
to prioritize development. If no-one stars it I'll assume no-one finds it useful :).
